Code to parse a string containing a sequence of arguments into an array of strings each of which is a single argument.
The intended purpose of this module is to create an implementation of CommandLineToArgvW (from the Win32 API), using only standard C++, enabling it's use in platforms other than Windows.
Also I did this as a little reverse engineering practice.
